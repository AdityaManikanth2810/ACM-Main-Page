And thus did we, the members of the ACM Student Chapter and non-members had a very successful Saturday Movie Night.`,

        aboutEvent: `Over the last few years, we have all been made aware of the Green Lock in web browsers and how to use it to identify a "secure website". In this talk, the speaker gave insights about what happens under the hood when a web browser identifies a website with a "Green Lock". The talk specifically answered questions like "Can we share our personal information—our phone number, credit card, bank account information—with a website that has this Green Lock?", "Who verifies the website and issues the Green Lock?", "Can we trust this issuer?". The webinar helped the audience gain exclusive knowledge about CyberSecurity and they also got tips on how to safely browse the internet and measures to be taken to ensure secure payment gateways.`,

The lecture has considered two different approaches to improve program performance by improving efficiency in the use of hardware technology: First, by improving the performance of modern high-level languages that are typically interpreted; and second, by building domain-specific architectures that greatly improve performance and efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs. In conclusion, the speaker suggested that the next decade will see a Cambrian explosion of novel computer architectures, meaning exciting times for computer architects in academia and industry.`,
